<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>My desk companion was a playful test into combining computer science and art. I wanted to make some sort of desk companion using electronic components and 3D printing.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>I started by designing on my iPad in Procreate, creating the initial concept and aesthetic vision for my companion. Once I had a clear direction, I moved to Fusion360 where I created a negative model to fit all the computer components perfectly.</p>

<p>Next, I 3D modeled in NomadSculpt around the negative to match both the 3D sketch and ensure everything fit the electronic components snugly. After modeling, I assembled the electronics to test if it would work—and it did!</p>

<p>I created animations in Aseprite and uploaded the code to the ESP32 microcontroller. Finally, I assembled everything together and it worked great!</p>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ESP32 microcontroller</li>
  <li>3D Printing (Fusion360, NomadSculpt)</li>
  <li>Digital Art (Procreate)</li>
  <li>Animation (Aseprite)</li>
  <li>Electronics assembly & programming</li>
</ul>
