# beneii.github.io

Welcome to **Ben's personal portfolio**! This repository powers the website hosted at <https://beneii.github.io>, built with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

## What you will find here

* A showcase of my projects, experience, and skills.
* Blog‐style posts and notes written in Markdown.
* Source code for custom styling, layouts, and components that make the site uniquely mine.

## How it works

GitHub Pages uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static-site generator to transform the Markdown and HTML in this repo into a fast, secure website. Every push to `main` automatically triggers a rebuild and deploy.

## Running locally

If you would like to see the site on your machine before publishing changes:

```bash
# 1. Install Ruby and Bundler (if you haven't already)
# 2. Install the project dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install

# 3. Start the local dev server
bundle exec jekyll serve
# Then visit http://localhost:4000
```

## Contributing / Issues

Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you spot something that could be improved. All feedback is welcome!
