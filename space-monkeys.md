<h2>Game Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Space Monkey, you're our last hope!</strong> Our spaceship has run out of fuel and the only way home is to gather elemental resources from Earth across multiple eras. Guide our brave simian hero through <strong>4 challenging levels (plus a tutorial)</strong>, each built around a unique elemental power.</p>

<p>Dash, jump, and unleash <em>Fire, Water, Earth, and Air</em> abilities to collect every element, appease the Monkey King, and blast the crew back into orbit. Levels intentionally feature tight jumps and tricky puzzles—keep trying, mastery is rewarded!</p>
