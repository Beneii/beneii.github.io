# Hello, I'm Benei ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate developer and technology enthusiast who loves turning ideas into functional, user-focused solutions.

## What I do

- **Software Development:** Building applications with clean, maintainable code.
- **Web Engineering:** Creating accessible and responsive web experiences.
- **Continuous Learning:** Experimenting with new tools, frameworks, and best practices.

## Outside of Code

When I'm not in front of a screen, you can find me exploring new music, dabbling in design, or enjoying the outdoors.

Feel free to connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Benei) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/Benei).
