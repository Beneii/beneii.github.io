        <p class="about-intro">I'm Ben, 22 years old, currently studying a Bachelor of Computing Science with a major in Interaction Design.</p>
        
        <p>I've always loved art, but I let go of it as a career path because, realistically, it's hard to make a living off it these days. I turned toward computer science because I've always been drawn to technology — it just made sense. Through interaction design, I've found the perfect middle ground that blends both: using my artistic eye to creatively design experiences, and my technical skills to actually make them real.</p>

        <p>My skill set isn't purely aesthetic, though. I love learning new skills and hobbies, especially anything that involves artificial intelligence and automation. Even though that's not part of my major, my knowledge in that area landed me an AI and automation internship, where I ended up outperforming people who actually study it.</p>
        
        <p>There's something exciting about visualising a project in my head and then bringing it to life by whatever means necessary. While this portfolio leans more on the technical side, I'm also into woodworking, textiles, 3D printing and modelling, and metal casting (yes, I've got a small furnace under the house) — plus melting down thrifted jewellery for fun.</p>

        <p>Lately, I've been diving into filmography and social media. I'm not trying to become the next micro-celebrity, but I think visual storytelling is incredibly important for my work. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have powerful analytics that show exactly what works and what doesn't in each part of a video, and I find that fascinating.</p>
        
        <p>One phrase I can't stand is "jack of all trades, master of none." Sure, I'm not a master in every area I explore, but that doesn't make them any less valuable. For example, in my Desk Companion project, I'm no expert 3D modeller — but by sculpting it myself and combining that with skills I am confident in, like pixel art and programming, I can create something that feels genuinely mine.</p>
        
        <p>Learning new skills doesn't just spread my energy thin — it builds a bigger arsenal of tools I can draw from. And honestly, that's exactly how I like to work.</p>
