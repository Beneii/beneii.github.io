<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>I was struggling a lot to keep track of all of my commitments in one space. I found out that Canvas likes to spread information across many different sources and I find it very difficult to find out what I have to do. Even when I'm in the mindset to do work in the library, I don't even know where to start. Like I know I have work to do but I don't know what I have due coming up. So I wanted a nice visualization of what I have due.</p>
